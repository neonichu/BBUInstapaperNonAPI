# BBUInstapaperNonAPI

__This is work in progress and shouldn't be used yet.__

Instapaper has an [official API][1], but humans have to approve your
taking part in it. For some reason, they didn't approve me and
requests for reasons were also ignored. That's unfortunate, so this
project exists to provide a way for me to pull out a list of 
recently added URLs. Maybe it will be helpful for you as well. If 
you haven't been ignored, you should really use [InstapaperKit][2]
instead.
